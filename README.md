## Robot-based Teleoperation and Wrench Localization

### INTRODUCTION
With the rapidly decreasing limitations of modern robotics, it is becoming increasingly possible to integrate robots into tasks that might prove unpleasant or dangerous to humans. Many developments of robots in this era center around robotâ€™s ability to operate in conditions that are hazardous to their human operators. Though the ultimate goal might be to achieve full robot autonomy, there are still a number of steps necessary to achieve robots that can perform even the most basic human tasks without any input from a human operator. In order to advance the capabilities of a standard SMP robot base, this team sought to develop a teleoperated system capable of remotely travelling to a target object and performing visual analysis on this object. This research was completed as a simulation and precursor to Challenge 2 of the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge, which seeks to integrate aerial and terrestrial robotics in order to simulate potential urban disaster relief.
